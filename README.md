Simple project from https://hyperskill.org/projects/109?track=2 made in order to practise coding in Python and SQL. It's aim was to mimic a banking system, proposing the user some options such as: creating new account, checking the balance, making transfers etc. Luhn algorithm was implemented so as to check if the card number was valid.
